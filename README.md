# parallel
A living table to draw parallels between languages

## Why

Often when I try to explore another language, I find myself trying to draw parallels (hence the name) to things that I am already familiar with. This way makes it easier for me to wrap my head around new workflows and concepts and speeds up adoption time.

## Data

| Language | Version Manager | Package Manager |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Go | Integrated |  |
| JS/TS | nvm | npm, yarn |
| Python | pyenv | pip |
| Rust |  | cargo |
